## Development process

- Bugs are always worked before enhancements
- Developers should work each issue according to a numbered branch corresponding to the issue `git checkout -b 123`
- To claim an issue, simply leave a comment with your request to work on it.
- If an issue is already claimed (assigned), do not attempt to claim it. Issues claimed by outside developers will have no assigned dev, but have the developers name in brackets.

**Please keep comments constructive and clean**

## Style guideline

We use [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) with custom configs to keep our code style consistent.

We also use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to auto-format our code. Be sure to either add a [text editor integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) to properly format your code changes.

## Branch structure & versioning

We use semantic versioning, but before a package reaches v1.0.0 all breaking changes as well as new features will be minor version bumps.

We have two main branches: master and development.

master represents the most recent released (published on npm) version.
