# learn-scilla 

An interactive tutorial for people to learn Scilla, Zilliqa’s smart contract language, through a gamification process. This is one of the [Zilliqa Ecosystem Grant Projects](https://blog.zilliqa.com/announcing-the-second-wave-of-zilliqa-ecosystem-grant-awardees-6e03edadcc0d). 

We are using Lighthouse to improve the quality of this web app with the [Lighthouse Report](https://lighthouse-dot-webdotdevsite.appspot.com/lh/html?url=https://learn-scilla.firebaseapp.com). 

## About Scilla

<p align="center"><img src="https://scilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/scilla-logo-color-transparent.png" align="center" width="130px" height="130px"/></p>

[Scilla](https://scilla-lang.org/) is an intermediate-level smart contract language being developed for [Zilliqa](https://zilliqa.com/). Scilla has been designed as a principled language with smart contract safety in mind. Scilla imposes a structure on smart contracts that will make applications less vulnerable to attacks by eliminating certain known vulnerabilities directly at the language-level.
