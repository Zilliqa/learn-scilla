<p align="center"><img src="https://scilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/scilla-logo-color-transparent.png" align="center" width="130px" height="130px"/></p>

[Scilla](https://scilla-lang.org/) is an intermediate-level smart contract language being developed for [Zilliqa](https://zilliqa.com/). Scilla has been designed as a principled language with smart contract safety in mind. Scilla imposes a structure on smart contracts that will make applications less vulnerable to attacks by eliminating certain known vulnerabilities directly at the language-level.
